								The summer of 2020 I was fortunate enough to work at Workiva as a Software Engineer Intern! The experience was amazing, I got to practice 
								a couple software languages I had never touched before, including Golang and Javascript. I also got to work with Docker and Kubernetes to
								deploy the code I was working. The great thing about the internship was that I was treated as any other developer, I wasn't restricted
								in what I was doing, so I had free reign to work directly on projects that were deployed to production environments.
							</p>
							<p class="body">
								The summer before my Freshman year in college, I took an 
								online course to get certified in Bash through Linux Professional 
								Institute, and I can proudly say I have the certificate of, <q>Linux Essentials</q> from LPI.
							</p>
							<p class="body">
								My Senior Project my Senior year of High School was an arcade machine. I decided to tackle that project because I've never really played arcade
								games before and I thought it would be good to test my capabilities. The hardest part of the project was designing and constructing the cabinet,
								since I was used to only writing software that I could easily change, taking precise measurements before making a cut in wood was a big step out of
								my comfort zone. After the cabinet was built, I bought a monitor off Craigslist, buttons and a joystick off Amazon, and grabbed a Raspberry Pi I had 
								lying around. I installed Raspbian on the Pi, wired the buttons and joystick together, hooked up the monitor, and spent a good chunk of time playing
								all sorts of games!

						Coding

					<p class="body">
						I started programming in Middle School and knew that my future would entail software engineering. Early in my high-school career I built this website to further establish
						my online presense and present myself at a professional capacity (and I'm still using the website 5+ years later!).
					</p>
					<p class="body">
						Thoughout those 5 years, I have expanded my knowledge in coding primarily through self-study. I have had practice in Bash, Golang, C, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
					</p>
					<p class="body">
						As mentioned, the summer before attending Univerity I took an online course which led to obtaining the "Linux Essentials" certificate from Linux Professional Institute.
					</p>
					<p class="body">
						Now, I'm attending the University of Colorado at Boulder to further develop my technical skills by working towards a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics.
						Insofar, I have been learning how to code in C and C++. You can check out my coding journey on my
						<a href="https://github.com/yyexela/Leetcode"  style="color: #668099;">GitHub</a> account!).
					</p>
					<p class="body">
						My latest experience with software engineering is being an intern at Workiva. As I mentioned earlier, I am treated like any other software engineer who works full time
						and have access to production environments and repositories. This allows me to work to the best of my abilities and expand my coding experience unhindered.

								My first competetive sport was swimming, and it'll always have a special place in my heart for that reason. I started practicing from a young 
								age and kept doing so through High School. I was awarded "most-dedicated" on the team one summer. In High School I was a part of the "Ranch Boys Swim and Dive"
								team, where I was on the varsity team for three years in a row.
							</p>
							<p class="body">
								Once I went to CU Boulder, I decided I wouldn't continue competetively swimming and that I would instead focus on developing other physical skills. I started
								going to the state-of-the-art recreational facility on-campus to lift weights and develop muscle that swimming wouldn't let me. I also decided to enroll in 
								"DNCE 1301 - Hip-Hop Dance Technique 1", where I learned Hip Hop party dance; furthermore, once COVID hit and all gym facilities closed, I took it upon myself
								to start learning how to break dance!
